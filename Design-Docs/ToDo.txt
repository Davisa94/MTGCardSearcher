A list of things to be done on the project:

TODO: After app works by polling aapi for card data everytime, cache card data by storing values for cards in card model
OPTION:
1: We can have a listitem that describes how many copies of a card exist in teh deck and constrain the 4 card copy there
2: we have a list of the cards and allow duplicates in the list up to four times, will get expensive for larger decksizes or card lists
With performance considerations, having a list of list items may have better performance implications and therefore option 1 is chosen.
